Added a dungeon game, controls are wasd to move, space to dash, q key and left and right mouse button to cast spells.

atm it isn't connected to the productivity coins aspect but that will come next hopefullyâ€‹ (hopefully the characters you pull from the gamba will change how you play the dungeon game)

This is a productivity todo list!
create tasks and complete them for coins, use the coins to buy characters (the characters feature is still a wip)
